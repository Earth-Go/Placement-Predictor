# 🎓 Placement Predictor App

This Streamlit web app predicts whether a student will get placed based on their **CGPA**, **IQ**, and **Profile Score**.

## 🔍 How It Works
- A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on student data.
- Inputs are scaled using a MinMaxScaler.
- The model returns a placement prediction (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed).
